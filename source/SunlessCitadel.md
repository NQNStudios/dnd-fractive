# Old Road

Once the characters are ready to leave Oakhurst, the
adventure truly begins. The overgrown Old Road winds
through rocky downs, near stands of old-growth oak,
and past abandoned farms. It is 7 miles from Oakhurst
to the Sunless Citadel.

# Ravine

*The Old Road passes to the east of a narrow ravine. At
the road's closest approach to the cleft, several broken
pillars jut from the earth where the ravine widens. Two
of the pillars stand straight, but most lean atop sloped
earth. Others are broken, and several have apparently
fallen into the dark depths. A few similar pillars are visible
on the opposite side of the ravine.
A sturdy, knotted rope is tied to one of the leaning pillars
on this side of the ravine.*

The ravine runs for several miles in either direction,
with an average depth and width of 30 feet. At the point
where it most closely intersects the Old Road, it widens
to 40 feet.

{{RavineInvestigating}}

**Investigating.** The pillars are worn and broken, and
graffiti in the Dwarvish alphabet covers most of them.
Characters who know Goblin (after translating the letters
from Dwarvish) recognize the inscriptions as warnings
and threats against potential trespassers.
A successful **DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) or
Wisdom (Survival) check** reveals that **the area in and
around the pillars has hosted many small campfires,
some of as recent as a month ago. Someone went to
some effort to hide the evidence of the camps from casual
scrutiny.**

{{RavineDescending}}

**Descending.** The rope tied to one of the leaning pillars
hangs down into the darkness of the ravine. Judging
by its good condition, the rope couldn't have been tied
there any longer than two or three weeks ago. From the
edge of the ravine, older and weathered handholds and
footholds can be seen carved into the cliff face. These
are goblin-carved.
Adventurers can easily climb down the knotted rope,
using the wall to brace themselves. Using the carved
indentations is slower but only slightly harder. The descent
is 50 feet to the [ledge (area 1).]({@Area1Ledge})

{{Area1Ledge}}

# Ledge

*A sandy ledge overlooks a subterranean gulf of darkness
to the west. The ledge is wide but rough. Sand, rocky
debris, and the bones of small animals cover it. [A roughhewn
stairwell zigs and zags down the side of the ledge,
descending into darkness.]({@SwitchbackStairs})*

![Map](assets/FortLevel.png)

The far wall of the chasm is 250 feet to the west, and the
bottom of the subterranean vault is 80 feet below where
the characters stand.
**Creatures.** Drawn by the occasional animal that accidentally
falls into the ravine, three giant rats lurk in
the rubble. They try to hide if they become aware of the
characters, and they ambush the first character who arrives
on the ledge without being quiet about it.
[Investigating.]({@LedgeInvestigating:inline})

[Switchback Stairs]({@SwitchbackStairs})

{{LedgeInvestigating}}

**Investigating.** A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival)
check reveals humanoid footprints, as well as rat
tracks of unusually large size. The footprints lead down
the stairs.
Among the rubble is an old ring of stones that contains
(and is covered by) the accumulated ash of hundreds
of fires, though no fire has been lit here for a few
years. Inside the ash pile are a few rough-hewn spear
tips of goblin manufacture and small animal bones.

{{SwitchbackStairs}}

# Switchback Stairs

The 5-foot-wide stairs that descend from area 1 are
roughly carved. They aren't dangerous to traverse, however,
except that combat while on the narrow path can
be risky. Three small landings lie along the route, the
first at 60 feet above the floor in [area 3]({@CrumbledCourtyard}), the second at 40
feet, and the third at 20 feet.
The characters might be able to see [area 3]({@CrumbledCourtyard}) as
they descend.

*A fortress emerges from the darkness. The subterranean
citadel, though impressive, seems long forgotten, if the
lightless windows,cracked crenellations, and leaning towers
are any indication. All is quiet, though a cold breeze
blows up from below, bringing with it the scent of dust
and a faint trace of rot.*

![Map](assets/FortLevel.png)

{{CrumbledCourtyard}}

*The narrow stairs empty into a small courtyard, apparently
the top of what was once a crenellated battlement.
The buried citadel has sunk so far into the earth that the
battlement is now level with the surrounding floor. That
floor stretches away to the north and south, composed of
a layer of treacherous, crumbled masonry, which reaches
to an unknown depth . To the west looms the surviving
structure of what must be the Sunless Citadel. A tower
stands on the west side of the courtyard.*

![Map](assets/Courtyard.png)

The stone courtyard, surrounded by crumbled masonry,
contains a trap and a wooden door.

[Wooden Door]({@TowerShell}).

{{MasonryDebris}}

**Masonry Debris.** An expanse of crumbled masonry
surrounds the entire citadel. Those attempting to cross
it immediately note its unsteadiness. The rubble is difficult
terrain. Anyone who moves across the debris must
make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check for each 10
feet traversed. On a failed check, the character is unable
to move. If the check fails by 5 or more, a slab of masonry
below the character shifts, dumping the character
into a debris-lined cavity. Climbing back out requires a
successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check; on a failed
check, the victim drops back into the cavity.

{{CourtyardCreatures}}

**Creatures.** Each time a creature falls into a cavity,
the noise is 10 percent likely to draw ld4 giant rats
from the dozens that infest the rubble field. Attracted
rats move carefully and stealthily through the rubble
to attack.

{{HiddenPit}}

# Hidden Pit

**Hidden Pit.** The map shows the location of a concealed
trapdoor that covers a IO-foot-square. 10-footdeep
pit. A 2-foot-wide catwalk on the we t edge allows
access to the door that leads to area 4. It takes a successful
DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to note the
trapdoor's unmortared edge. Then, a successful DC 10
Intelligence (Investigation) check lets a character deduce
the location of the catwalk and how the pit operates.
If a creature steps on the trapdoor, the lid flips open,
dumping the creature into the pit. With a successful DC
15 Dexterity check, a creature can use thieves' tools to
jam the lid shut. A mechanism resets the trap 1 minute
after the door opens, pushing it back into the closed
position. The mechanism is in the pit wall under the
catwalk. A creature can jam it in the open position with
a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.
If this check succeeds by 5 or more, the mechanism can
be permanently disabled if desired.
**Creature.** The pit contains two goblin skeletons, one
goblin that has been dead for about a day, and one live
giant rat. The rat, which slipped into the pit to feed on
the fresh goblin but was caught when the trap reset,
attacks creatures inside the pit or climbs out to attack
those nearby.
**Treasure.** The goblin corpse has a scimitar and a
shield, as well as 23 sp and 4 gp in a belt pouch.

{{TowerShell}}

# Tower Shell

*This circular area is cobbled with cracked granite, upon
which sprawl the bodies of four goblins, apparently slain
in combat. One corpse stands with its back against the
western wall, the spear that killed it still skewering it and
holding it upright. Three wooden doors lead from this
area. A hollow tower of loose masonry reaches thirty
feet into the air, but the intervening floors and stairs are
gone, except for a couple of crumbled ledges.*

![Map](assets/TowerShell.png)

**Bodies.** Investigation reveals that the four goblins
have been dead for quite a while, and rats have gnawed
at them. The bodies have been looted. If someone removes
the spear pinning the goblin to the wall, the body
slumps to reveal Draconic runes on the wall behind it.
Those who know the Draconic language can read the
runes as "Ashardalon."
**Secret Door.** A trapped secret door leads to [area 5.]({@HiddenRoom})
Finding the door requires a successful **DC 20 Wisdom
(Perception) check.** The door opens by way of a masonry
block that also serves as a lever, which can be pushed in
on the left side or pulled out from the right.
**Needle Trap.** If the lever is pulled out, that movement
sets off a needle trap. The needle extends 3 inches out
of the opening, dealing 1 piercing damage to whoever
pulled the lever. Someone who carefully and slowly
pulls the lever open can easily see the needle before it
strikes. Disabling the needle requires thieves' tools and
a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. If the check fails
by 5 or more, the trap goes off, stabbing the character
unless the character succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw.

[Northwest door]({@JustAHallway})
[Southwest door]({@OldApproach})

{{HiddenRoom}}

*This pocket chamber is damp and cold. The skeletons of
three long-dead archers slump against rubble-filled arrow
slits along the east and south wall.*

The skeletons date back to the time before the citadel
plunged into the earth. That calamity killed all three
archers, at the same time instilling in them the curse of
undeath. If anyone enters this chamber, the three skele-tons animate, pinpoints of red fire sparkling in their eye
sockets as they rise.
Treasure. Each skeleton has twenty arrows, 2d10 sp,
ldlO gp, and one +l arrow in a special socket on the
quiver. Because the skeletons are mindless, they don't
use the magical arrows.

# Old Approach

*The masonry walls of this twenty-foot-wide hall are in
poor repair. The far end has collapsed, filling the southern
section with rubble. The western wall is in much
better shape than the other walls, and it holds a stone
door with a rearing dragon carved in relief on it. The door
has a single keyhole, situated in the rearing dragon's
open mouth.*

![Map](assets/OldApproach.png)

[**Dragon Door.**]({@Gallery}) The door that is carved to look like a
dragon has a mechanical lock as well as an arcane Jock
spell cast on it. The Strength (Athletics) check to defeat
the arcane lock is DC 30, and the Dexterity check to
bypass the magical lock using thieves' tools is DC 25.
Casting a knock spell on the door suppresses the magical
lock for 10 minutes, lowering the DCs by 10 during
that time. The mechanical lock remains intact if the
magical lock is bypassed, requiring another knock spell
or the use of the key. The key, which bypasses the magical
lock as well as the mechanical one, is in area 21.
**Creature.** One giant rat hides in the rubble. The rat
attacks anyone who moves to within 5 feet of the edge of
the rubble or anyone left alone in this area.

{{Gallery}}

# Gallery of Forlorn Notes

*As the door opens, a hissing noise and a puff of dust
around the door indicate that the chamber beyond has
been sealed for ages . Dust, long undisturbed, covers every
surface in this large gallery. The air here is stale.
Three alcoves are on the north wall, and one is on the
south wall. Each alcove contains a dust-covered stone
pedestal with a fist-sized crystalline globe resting on it.
The globes in the northern alcoves are cracked and dark,
but the globe in the southern alcove glows with a soft
blue light. Faint tinkling notes issue from it.*

{{GlobeEffects}}

Brooding
music begins to play throughout the area, and the
sound carries into areas 6, 8, and 9 if the doors to those
areas are open. Any creature that can hear the music
must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful
save, a creature is immune to the music of the
globe for 24 hours. On a failed save, a creature becomes
charmed and, while charmed in this way, can take only
the Dash action and move toward area 3.
The effect on a creature ends once that creature
reaches the floor beyond the pit trap in area 3. If an
affected creature is prevented from moving to area 3,
the creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful
save. The effect ends on its own 1 minute after the
creature can no longer hear the music. A creature can
escape the music by being on the other side of a closed
door that leads to the gallery, or by vacating the area (including
adjacent rooms) where the music is audible.
The globe has AC 10 and 10 hit points. If it is attacked
or handled, the music becomes louder, audible in areas
4 and 10 if the doors to those areas are open. The DC
of the Wisdom saving throw then increases to 20. [If the
globe is reduced to O hit points or taken from the room,
it cracks and goes dark and silent. It no longer functions.]({#deactivateGlobe})
