An adventurer dude is sobbing at a table alone. His friend (**We were JUST friends**)
went down the well into the dungeon out of a drunken dare, and he actually died.
He needs you to go down there just to retrieve the body

[Durnan]({@Durnan}) comes down after you and is like, "Don't go further in the dungeon.
I don't have to do a lot of paperwork when someone dies down here, but
it's still a non-zero amount, so I don't want anyone else to die tonight, at least."

That's when he makes you go back upstairs and the first mini-dungeon is over.
When you bring back the corpse, Adventurer dude will already be making out with
another guy. Who has the same lumberjack vibe.

The proprietor of the Yawning Portal is something of an
enigma. Blessed with a seemingly limitless life span by
rreasures he brought back from his expedition nearly
vo centuries ago, he is as much a fixture in the taproom
as the well.
Durnan is a man of few words. He expects to be paid
for his time, and will offer insight and rumors only in
return for hard cash. "We know the odds and take our
chances," he says, whether he is breaking up a card
game that has turned violent or refusing the pleas of adve
nturers trapped at the bottom of the well who are unable
to pay for a ride up. Despite his stony heart, he is an
excellent source of information about Undermountain
and other dungeons, provided one can pay his price.
Personality Trait: Isolation. It's a cruel world. All
people have to fend for themselves. Self-sufficiency is
the only path to success.
Ideal: Independence. Someone who can stand alone
can stand against anything.
Bond: The Yawning Portal. This place is my only
home. My friends and family are long gone. I love this
place, but I try not to get attached to the people here. I'll
outlive them all. Lucky me.
Flaw: Heartless. If you want sympathy, the Temple of
Ilmater is in the Sea Ward. No matter how bad things
are, you'll be gone in a blink of an eye.

Durnin won't take you seriously, he's actually drinking with other patrons,
doesn't glamorize adventure, and will tell you to go elsewhere.

# RESCUE MISSION
Another party of adventurers, locally based, delved
into the Sunless Citadel a month past. They were never
seen again . Two human members of that ill-fated party
were brother and sister, Talgen Hucrele (a fighter) and
Sharwyn Hucrele (a wizard). They were part of an important
merchant family based in the nearby village of
Oakhurst. Kerowyn Hucrele, the matriarch of the family,
offers salvage rights to you and your team if you can find
and return with the two lost members of her family- or
at least return the gold signet rings worn by the missing
brother and sister. She also offers a reward of 125 gp
per signet ring, per character. If the characters bring
back the Hucreles in good shape (of good mind and
body), she offers to double the reward.
