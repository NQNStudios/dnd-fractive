# Nowhere station

Galethspyrans call this station the "Nowhere station" because the only people
who ever disembark here, are heading to Oakhurst. They will laugh and murmer
about the adventurers for going there.

The train runs to Ardev.

# Oakhurst

Farming village dealing with an outbreak of the flu, and from which a local
band of adventurers has gone missing.

# The Ol' Boar

Proprietor is a halfling lady named Remora.

## Tom

When the adventurers first get here, Tom will be ranting to a table of assenting
villagers that Naronder, the village
"scientist", unfairly outbid him for the Kobolds' "healing fruit" this year. His
kids are both suffering from a mysterious illness, and he can't help them,
because [Naronder]({@NarondersCompound}) thought he needed the fruit more, for his experiments.

{{NarondersCompound}}

# Naronder's compound

It's a large house on the outskirts of Oakhurst. Smoke is always coming out
the chimney because he's constantly running experiments.

## Naronder

Actually kind of a normal dude (which is weird in Eberron). He's discovered
the concept of germs and is trying to invent a vaccine.

His wife was the first to develop the mysterious disease he calls "flu" and
in testing an experimental vaccine on Tom's kids, he caused them to fall ill, too.

[He's also trying to learn the secret of the goblins' magical fruit.]({@SkyrakerForest})

{{SkyrakerForest}}

# Skyraker Forest

Woods nearby Oakhurst.

## Naronder's secret fruit plot

He planted the seeds of the goblins' magical fruit in a secret plot in
the woods. The saplings, while at first seeming promising, turned into
[twig blights]({@TwigBlight}) and walked away (but make the party figure that one out).
